## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Muted teal (#73A7A7), a calming and professional hue suitable for an educational environment.
- Background color: Very light, desaturated teal (#F0F5F5), provides a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Dusty rose (#A77373), an analogous color, offering a contrast for interactive elements and important information.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that combines a modern look and a little warmth or personality, making it ideal for educational content.
- Use simple, outline-style icons for easy recognition. Icons should be related to the module or section they represent (e.g., a book for the library, a calendar for events).
- Employ a clean, card-based layout. Important data will have more visual weight, allowing parents, students, and teachers to understand important concepts easily.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to guide users through the interface and provide feedback on interactions (e.g., a smooth transition when navigating between sections).
